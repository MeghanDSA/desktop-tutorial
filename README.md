## About me
I am a DSA (data science and analytics) student at Clemson University and will be completing
my MS in December 2022. I already have an MS in English from Clemson, as well.

## Interests
I am particularly interested in:
- Language processing
- Language/corpus analytics
- Using analytics for good, not evil

## This is my family and I dressed as characters from Monty Python
